Problem Bid2Ship Solves
1. For Businesses (Shippers)

Hard to find reliable drivers quickly → Leads to delays in delivery.

High logistics costs → Businesses often overpay because there’s no transparent system to compare driver rates.

Delivery inefficiency → Poor tracking, no real-time updates, and uncertainty about shipments.

Dependence on middlemen/brokers → Adds extra cost and reduces trust.

2. For Truck Drivers

Lack of consistent work → Drivers struggle to find return loads, leading to wasted trips (empty backhauls).

Unfair or unstable rates → Middlemen reduce their earnings.

Limited visibility → Hard for small/independent drivers to compete with big fleet operators.

Low trust & recognition → No formal reputation system to build credibility.

3. For the Logistics Industry (Overall)

Inefficiency across the supply chain → Delays, higher costs, poor utilization of resources.

Lack of transparency → Both businesses and drivers suffer from mistrust.

Fragmentation → Too many small, disconnected players make it hard to scale.
